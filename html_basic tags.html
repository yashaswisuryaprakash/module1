The pan-India success of Prashanth Neel's 2018 period action film K.G.F: Chapter 1, 
which became the highest-grossing Kannada film, helped Yash attain nationwide recognition in India and win his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor.
 He won further praise for his performance in the sequel, K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022), which ranks as the fourth highest-grossing Indian film.
